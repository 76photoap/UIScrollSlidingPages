UIScrollSlidingPages
=========================

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS control that will eventually allow you to add multiple view controllers and have them scroll horizontally, each with a header view in a separate scroller that shows next and previous items in the scroller, and scrolls in proportion to the content view.

Usage
---
* You should not use this control yet. It is still in development! It will likely change a lot.
