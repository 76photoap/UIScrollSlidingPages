UIScrollSlidingPages
=========================

![Screenshot](Screenshots/uiscrollslidingpages.gif)

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS control that will eventually allow you to add multiple view controllers and have them scroll horizontally, each with a smaller header view that scrolls in proportion as the content scrolls. Similar in style to the Groupon app.

Usage

* You should not use this control yet. It is still in development! It will likely change a lot. I am still writing the documentation.
